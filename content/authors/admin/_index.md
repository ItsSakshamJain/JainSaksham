I'm the **Head of Finance & Operations** at [Better Bite VC](https://betterbite.vc/), where I focus on investment strategy, financial structuring, and due diligence for early-stage startups in **climate tech** and **alternative proteins**.  

With a background in **finance, venture capital, and M&A**, I specialize in **fund management, startup financial strategy, and exits**. Before joining Better Bite, I worked at **EY in transaction advisory**, conducting buy-side and sell-side financial due diligence.  

Iâ€™m passionate about sustainable business models, financial efficiency, and supporting mission-driven founders. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, exploring investment trends, and reading about business strategy.
